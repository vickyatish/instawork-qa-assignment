# What's Instawork?
Instawork is a technology company operating an on-demand staffing platform that connects businesses with a network of vetted hourly workers. This service is facilitated through three distinct applications. For individuals seeking employment, the Instawork mobile app allows them to find and select shifts that fit their schedules (Pro app). For companies, the Instawork for Business mobile app (Biz app) and a corresponding web application (Biz web) provide the tools to post available shifts and manage their temporary workforce. Instawork's business model is centered on the gig economy, earning revenue by charging businesses a commission for each successfully filled shift.
