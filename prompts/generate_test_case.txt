CONTEXT:
{iw_overview}

CHANGE REQUEST:
{change_request}

TEST CASE REQUIREMENTS:
- Type: {test_case_type}
- Title: {title}
- Priority: {priority}

EXISTING TEST CASES (for reference and consistency):
{existing_test_cases}

Create a comprehensive test case that follows the existing pattern and covers the new functionality.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow the exact JSON schema structure
2. Make steps realistic and specific to Instawork's platform
3. Ensure the test case is executable and verifiable
4. Use consistent terminology with existing test cases

    "priority": "P2 - High",
    "preconditions": "Setup requirements",
    "steps": [
        {{
